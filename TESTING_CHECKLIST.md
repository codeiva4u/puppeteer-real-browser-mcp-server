- [ ] Tool schemas include required parameters
- [ ] No "Method not found" errors

---

## Phase 2: Basic Browser Operations

### 2.1 Browser Initialization Test
**Prompt for Claude Code CLI:**
```
Use the puppeteer-real-browser MCP server to:
1. Initialize a browser in headless mode
2. Verify the browser started successfully
3. Show any Chrome path detection messages

Test both headless=true and headless=false modes if possible.
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Browser initializes without errors
- [ ] Chrome path is auto-detected and logged to stderr (not stdout)

- [ ] Both headless modes work

### 2.2 Simple Navigation Test
**Prompt for Claude Code CLI:**
```
Use the puppeteer-real-browser MCP server to:
1. Initialize a browser (headless mode)
2. Navigate to https://example.com
3. Take a screenshot of the page
4. Get the page title or content
5. Close the browser

Verify each step completes successfully.
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Navigation completes without "frame detached" errors
- [ ] Screenshot is captured successfully (base64 image returned)
- [ ] Page content is retrieved
- [ ] Browser closes cleanly
- [ ] No session-related errors

---

## Phase 3: Error Recovery Testing

1. Initialize a browser (non-headless mode)
2. Navigate to https://www.cursor.com/dashboard
3. Take a screenshot
4. Close the browser

This scenario previously caused "Navigating frame was detached", "Maximum call stack size exceeded", and screenshot session errors. Verify the retry mechanism and stack overflow protection works.
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Navigation succeeds (with or without retries)
- [ ] Screenshot captures successfully
- [ ] No "Session closed" errors
- [ ] No "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors
- [ ] Retry mechanism engages if needed (check logs)
- [ ] Browser recovery works if session fails
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents infinite loops

### 3.2 Complex Navigation Test
**Prompt for Claude Code CLI:**
```
Test complex browser operations that may trigger retry logic:
1. Initialize browser
2. Navigate to https://httpbin.org/delay/2 (slow loading page)
3. Wait for the page to load
4. Take a full-page screenshot
5. Navigate to https://httpbin.org/status/200
6. Take another screenshot
7. Close browser

Monitor for any retry attempts or error recovery.
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Handles slow-loading pages correctly
- [ ] Multiple navigations work without session loss
- [ ] Screenshots work after navigation changes
- [ ] No frame detachment errors
- [ ] Proper timeout handling

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Features Testing

### 4.1 Random Scroll Test
**Prompt for Claude Code CLI:**
```
Test the random scroll stealth feature:
1. Initialize browser (non-headless)
2. Navigate to https://example.com
3. Use random_scroll to simulate natural scrolling
4. Take a screenshot to verify actions
5. Close browser
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Random scroll executes with timing variations
- [ ] No bot detection triggers
- [ ] Scrolling appears natural

### 4.2 Error Handling Categories Test
**Prompt for Claude Code CLI:**
```
Test the error categorization system by attempting operations that may fail:
1. Try to click on a non-existent element
2. Try to navigate to an invalid URL
3. Try to take a screenshot after browser is closed
4. Try to interact with elements before page loads

Verify that different error types are handled appropriately.
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] "Element not found" errors are categorized correctly
- [ ] Navigation errors are handled with retries
- [ ] Session errors trigger browser recovery
- [ ] Helpful error messages are provided
- [ ] No undefined or generic errors

---

## Phase 5: Performance and Reliability Testing

### 5.1 Session Management Test
**Prompt for Claude Code CLI:**
```
Test session validation and recovery:
1. Initialize browser
2. Navigate to https://example.com
3. Take a screenshot
4. Simulate session loss (if possible) or continue with multiple operations
5. Navigate to https://httpbin.org/get
6. Take another screenshot
7. Get page content
8. Close browser

Monitor for session validation checks and automatic recovery.
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Session validation occurs before operations
- [ ] Invalid sessions are detected and recovered
- [ ] Multiple operations maintain session integrity
- [ ] No unexpected session terminations

### 5.2 Cross-Platform Chrome Detection Test
**Prompt for Claude Code CLI:**
```
Test Chrome path detection and custom configuration:
1. Initialize browser with default settings (auto-detect Chrome)
2. Show the detected Chrome path in the logs
3. If possible, test with custom Chrome path configuration
4. Verify browser launches successfully with detected path

Report the detected Chrome path and any detection issues.
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Chrome path is detected automatically
- [ ] Detection works for current platform
- [ ] Path is logged to stderr (not stdout)
- [ ] Browser launches with detected executable
- [ ] Custom paths work if specified

2. Check that prompts/list returns empty array (not "Method not found")
3. Verify tools/list returns all expected tools
4. Test that all JSON-RPC responses are valid
5. Confirm no non-JSON output pollutes the protocol stream
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] resources/list returns `{"resources": []}`
- [ ] prompts/list returns `{"prompts": []}`
- [ ] tools/list returns array of 11 tools
- [ ] All responses are valid JSON-RPC 2.0
- [ ] No stdout pollution with non-JSON content

### 6.2 Claude Code CLI Integration Test
