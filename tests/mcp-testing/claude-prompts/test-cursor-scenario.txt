Using the puppeteer-test-server MCP server, please test the previously failing scenario:
1. Initialize a browser in non-headless mode (headless: false)
2. Navigate to https://www.cursor.com/dashboard
3. Wait for the page to load
4. Take a screenshot
5. Close the browser

This previously caused "Navigating frame was detached" errors. Please report:
- Whether the navigation succeeds
- If any retries were needed
- Whether the screenshot was captured successfully
- Any error messages encountered
